            <p class="lead">Like Martin Margiela, Lang abruptly ended his eponymous line and his career in fashion in 2005. Today, the company continues without him. But if Lang's contribution to fashion history is pragmatism, Margiela's is deconstructionism. He transformed everyday clothing into fashion, making it accessible to all people at all times.</p>
                <p class="lead">Men's fashion was a primary focus of his business, just like it was for his contemporaries Raf Simons. This parka's owner, historian David Casavant, claims that "they didn't approach menswear as a side piece to womenswear and truly made it its own art form" (as well as hundreds of other pieces by Lang). The 1998 original of this shimmering, almost ethereal fishtail parka still works today.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Painted Leather Aviator Jacket <span class="text-muted">(Yohji Yamamoto)</span></h2>
            <p class="lead">Yohji Yamamoto, the famous anti-fashion designer, has a distinctive visual sense that is androgynous, drapey, and black. The designs of Yohji are inexplicably both instantly recognizable and completely anonymous.</p> 
            <p class="lead">For this reason, it's fascinating when there are sporadic colored flourishes. The line featured a series of leather aviator jackets with hand-painted pinup-girl motifs—a military reference developed in response to the Gulf War—and is widely regarded as his best and most prized collection. It was presented in Tokyo alongside Comme des Garçons. It is one of Yohji's most sought-after designs while also being one of the least recognized as Yohji, in classic Yohji fashion.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Floral Embroidered Denim Jeans <span class="text-muted"> (Tom Ford For Gucci)</span></h2>
            <p class="lead">Anyone with an Instagram account can tell you that Gucci is red-hot, thanks to visionary designer Alessandro Michele's baroque new-wave update. But who remembers when Tom Ford was at the helm?</p> 
            <p class="lead">From 1994 to 2006, Ford sexed up Gucci's relatively staid leather-goods business. He supercharged the wattage with help from his friends Kate Moss and Mario Testino, staged provocative runway shows, and made the kind of louche, expertly crafted menswear that rock stars and rich guys couldn't resist. Fast-forward 20 years to A$AP Rocky wearing a very similar pair of Michele-designed floral Gucci jeans on the street, and you've got yourself a nice bit of archival-fashion synergy.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Psych Girl Shirt<span class="text-muted"> (Helmut Lang)</span></h2>
            <p class="lead">A legend in his own right, JPG wasn't really a men's-archival fixture until Lil Uzi Vert started wearing the designer's distinctive graphic pieces. (Marilyn Manson, Uzi's idol, is also a fan.) “We were the first store that really pushed all our chips in on Gaultier,” says Kyle Julian Skye Muhlfriedel, cofounder of the archival shop Middleman and owner of the shirt pictured here. “I found myself devising all sorts of questionable small-sample metrics like ‘average likes per brand’ and ‘drop-day sale percentage’ to prove why we needed to post more. But it was Uzi wearing Gaultier that really changed everything [in 2019]. He purchased a ‘Satan’ jacket from us, and after posting it on his Instagram, the demand for Gaultier went through the roof.”.</p>
