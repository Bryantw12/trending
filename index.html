            <p class="lead">Like Martin Margiela, Lang abruptly ended his eponymous line and his career in fashion in 2005. Today, the company continues without him. But if Lang's contribution to fashion history is pragmatism, Margiela's is deconstructionism. He transformed everyday clothing into fashion, making it accessible to all people at all times. Men's fashion was a primary focus of his business, just like it was for his contemporaries Raf Simons. This parka's owner, historian David Casavant, claims that "they didn't approach menswear as a side piece to womenswear and truly made it its own art form" (as well as hundreds of other pieces by Lang). The 1998 original of this shimmering, almost ethereal fishtail parka still works today.</p>

            <p class="lead">Yohji Yamamoto, the famous anti-fashion designer, has a distinctive visual sense that is androgynous, drapey, and black. The designs of Yohji are inexplicably both instantly recognizable and completely anonymous. For this reason, it's fascinating when there are sporadic colored flourishes. The line featured a series of leather aviator jackets with hand-painted pinup-girl motifs—a military reference developed in response to the Gulf War—and is widely regarded as his best and most prized collection. It was presented in Tokyo alongside Comme des Garçons. It is one of Yohji's most sought-after designs while also being one of the least recognized as Yohji, in classic Yohji fashion.</p>
